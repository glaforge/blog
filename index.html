<h2 id="_a_new_job">A new job</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is my first blog post after 4 months being a full time employee of <a href="https://www.gradle.org">Gradle Inc.</a>! I am pretty excited by this job, even though so far it didn&#8217;t give me much time to contribute to <a href="http://groovy-lang.org">Apache Groovy</a> (but we did manage to release 2.4.4 though). One of the reasons I joined the company was because I love technical challenges. And <a href="https://www.gradle.org">Gradle</a> has a lot of them, with an incredible team of smart people working together to make software automation better. This week, I worked on my first true challenge, and I must confess that I miserably failed :-) This is a long post, and anyone who ever fought against the infamous "PermGen space error" in their application is going to understand why&#8230;</p>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_codenarc_as_the_source_of_a_leak">CodeNarc as the source of a leak?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first suspicious piece of code that draw our attention was <a href="http://codenarc.sourceforge.net/">CodeNarc</a>. CodeNarc is a source code quality analysis tool for Groovy, which is used by a lot of Groovy developers, including in Gradle itself (since Gradle intensively makes use of Groovy). <a href="http://codenarc.sourceforge.net/">CodeNarc</a> can be seen as the equivalent of FindBugs for Groovy code. And problems seemed to start with an upgrade of the Gradle CodeNarc plugin to use CodeNarc 0.23. We actually saw reports like <a href="https://discuss.gradle.org/t/codenarc-performance-drop-after-versions-update/9677">this one</a> in the forums or <a href="https://github.com/CodeNarc/CodeNarc/issues/116">this other one</a> in GitHub but thought that the PermGen error was just a consequence of <a href="http://codenarc.sourceforge.net/">CodeNarc</a> including more rules: rules are written in Groovy, so compiled down to classes and classes eat PermGen. So increasing the PermGen space was enough, and it did actually solve the error. Problem solved. Or not. The riddle only started for me with a seemingly insignificant question on our internal mailing lists: "Can some investigate why our build sometimes fails with a PermGen space error?", and I volunteered.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Interestingly, I had just finished pushing an upgrade of <a href="https://www.gradle.org">Gradle</a> to Groovy 2.4.4 on our master branch, and I had noticed that I had to increase the PermGen space too. At first, I naively thought that it was also required because Groovy 2.4 consumed more memory, but I was wrong. I should have known, because before joining Gradle, I had actually worked on Groovy for Android, and a consequence of this work was that Groovy 2.4 had a reduced memory footprint: we generate less bytecode, which directly relates to a reduced PermGen space usage. So why on earth would Groovy 2.4 require more memory? And what is the relation with the CodeNarc plugin? Actually this plugin works in a Gradle version that uses Groovy 2.3.10, so why would there be a relation between the two?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In such a case, your best friend is a profiler. But as I will explain here, it can also lead you to wrong tracks. Be careful. The second best friend is the JVM options <code>-XX:+TraceClassLoading</code> and <code>+XX:+TraceClassUnloading</code>. I also used <code>-XX:SoftRefLRUPolicyMSPerMB=0</code>, an option that I had no idea it existed before my friend David Gageot told me. Basically, it will force the garbage collector to agressively collect all soft references, which is very useful to understand, in combination with the 2 other options, from which classloader we are leaking memory.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first wrong track was actually thinking that <a href="http://codenarc.sourceforge.net/">CodeNarc</a> was the source of the problem. I <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/topic/gradle-dev/w9F0PsCfI4Y/discussion">wrote an email on the gradle-dev list</a>, explaining my findings, and I had indeed found a lot of classes from <a href="http://codenarc.sourceforge.net/">CodeNarc</a> were not unloaded. Before I go further, let&#8217;s explain how the JVM is supposed to behave with regards to classes in Java 7. We all know that objects are garbage collected, but for a lot of people, classes are not. That&#8217;s why we have the PermGen space (which has disappeared in Java 8 but that&#8217;s another story): this segregated space of the JVM memory is used to store classes. And in Java, a class is loaded by a classloader. There is a strong reference between a class and its classloader. But what the JVM is able to do is actually simple: if there&#8217;s no instance of the class which is strongly reachable <strong>and</strong> that the classloader is neither strongly reachable, then both the class and the classloader can be unloaded. This means that PermGen can be recovered, and it is pretty useful, especially for a language like Groovy which can generate a lot of classes at runtime.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In Gradle, and particularily in the Gradle CodeNarc plugin, <a href="http://codenarc.sourceforge.net/">CodeNarc</a> is executed through an Ant task, which spawns its own isolated classloader, containing both the <a href="http://codenarc.sourceforge.net/">CodeNarc</a> and Groovy classes. So when the plugin execution is finished, if we do not keep track of the classloader, classes should be garbage collected. So a good candidate for the memory leak was actually the <code>IsolatedAntBuilder</code> that Gradle uses to execute the Ant task. And guess what? There is such a leak, because the <code>DefaultIsolatedAntBuilder</code> performs classloader caching! That was also discovered by my colleague Sterling, who immediately spot that: while we do cache the classloaders, keeping a strong reference on them, we don&#8217;t have any code to release the classloader in case of memory pressure. Conclusion, we&#8217;ve found the memory leak, hurray! And it has nothing to do with <a href="http://codenarc.sourceforge.net/">CodeNarc</a> or <a href="http://groovy-lang.org">Apache Groovy</a>, pfiew!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So I immediately tried to disable the cache, which turned to be pretty trivial. Run the build again and&#8230; another PermGen space error. No CodeNarc classes unloaded, no Groovy classes unloaded. Wow. So the problem wasn&#8217;t solved, first "oh my!" moment of the week: there was <strong>another</strong> leak.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One test I did, then, is to totally comment out the code that, in the ant builder code, performed the definition of the CodeNarc task. Eventually, there was only that code left in the CodeNarc plugin:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="prettyprint groovy language-groovy"><code>    @TaskAction
    void run() {
        logging.captureStandardOutput(LogLevel.INFO)
        def classpath = new DefaultClassPath(getCodenarcClasspath())
        antBuilder.withClasspath(classpath.asFiles).execute {
            // ... thou shalt not leak!
        }
    }</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I executed the code again, and there was definitely a leak: after several loops, a PermGen error occurred. <a href="http://codenarc.sourceforge.net/">CodeNarc</a> was ruled out as the source of the leak. After some hours of trials, study of memory snapshots, I eventually came out with a piece of code that reproduces the problem independently of Gradle:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="prettyprint java language-java"><code>int i = 0;
try {
    while (true) {
        i++;
	URLClassLoader loader = new URLClassLoader(
            new URL[]{new File(GROOVY_JAR).toURI().toURL()},
            ClassLoader.getSystemClassLoader().getParent());
        Class system = loader.loadClass("groovy.lang.GroovySystem");
        system.getDeclaredMethod("getMetaClassRegistry").invoke(null);
        loader.close();
    }
} catch (OutOfMemoryError e) {
    System.err.println("Failed after " + i + " loadings");
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As you can see, the code is very simple: it creates a new isolated classloader, which only contains Groovy on classpath. Then it invokes the creation of the Groovy runtime, by asking the metaclass registry, then it closes the classloader. On my JVM, after about 40 runs, the code fails with a PermGen space error: despite the fact that no class, no object is kept out of the classloader, the Groovy runtime is not unloaded, leading to a memory leak. The key point here is that I had noticed some oddities during my hours of debugging: a class, named <code>ClassInfo</code>, was at the center of those oddities.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="https://groups.google.com/group/gradle-dev/attach/cb238029e9b0/leak.png?part=0.1&authuser=0" alt="ClassInfo leak">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In particular, although <a href="https://www.yourkit.com/features/">YourKit</a> (the profiler I was using) was telling me that all classes, all classloaders were weakly or softly reachable (btw, it&#8217;s really a pity that <a href="https://www.yourkit.com/features/">YourKit</a> doesn&#8217;t show them separately, that is, weakly referenced objects from softly referenced ones), the classes were not garbage collected. Also strangely, some classes appeared as GC roots, meaning they could be collected, but they weren&#8217;t! And when I navigated through some of the duplicate classes I was seeing, <code>ClassInfo</code> was present, as a value of a map entry of class value. Here we are, I had found the real source of the leak. Something had changed in Groovy. And the fact that <a href="http://codenarc.sourceforge.net/">CodeNarc</a> was leaking since 0.23 was just a side effect of upgrading its dependency to Groovy 2.4! So despite Gradle was using Groovy 2.3.10, CodeNarc, by default, was using a more recent version of Groovy. That doesn&#8217;t explain <strong>why</strong> it leaks yet, but we now know who is responsible: Groovy.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_classvalue_friend_or_foe">ClassValue, friend or foe?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since Groovy 2.4, Groovy uses a new mechanism for storing its runtime metadata in case you run on JDK 7 or later: <code>ClassValue</code>. <code>ClassValue</code> allows storing information on the class level. Typically, a language like Groovy would use it to store the metaclass of a class. In practice, Groovy doesn&#8217;t directly store the metaclass here, but a higher level concept called <code>ClassInfo</code>, which in turns gives access to the metaclass of a class.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before Groovy 2.4, all that information was stored directly in the <code>ClassInfo</code> class itself, through a private static field. <code>ClassInfo</code> is therefore the global entry point for accessing runtime information about a class. While Groovy 2.4 still uses <code>ClassInfo</code> as an entry point, there are 2 possible storage mechanisms, based on the underlying JDK. If <code>ClassValue</code> is available; which is the case for any JDK 7+, then it is used, otherwise we fallback on the old mechanism. <code>ClassValue</code> is supposed to be more efficient and more direct. Of course, in any case (old and new storage mechanism), it is memory sensitive: in case a class is not available anymore, its <code>ClassInfo</code> is removed. What <code>ClassValue</code> storage provides is basically the same as ThreadLocal, but at the Class level instead of the Thread level. Users are allowed to store information here, but one should be aware that as thread locals, if you start using it, you may face memory leaks if you don&#8217;t use it properly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That&#8217;s for the theory, let&#8217;s see how in practice this change led to a giant memory leak in the Gradle build.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The theory is that <code>ClassValue</code> should behave like ThreadLocal. That is, the entries stored in the internal map of the Class class, should be garbage collected when the referent is not strongly referenced anymore. This behavior is however not what the JVM does. It was confirmed to me by Charles Nutter (JRuby) a few hours later: although we all expected the JVM to collect the unreachable, it does not.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Uh. Second "oh my!" moment of the weak. I had now a candidate (Groovy) and a reason (<code>ClassInfo</code> leaking). However, it doesn&#8217;t explain by itself why the class loader is not garbage collected: if Groovy stores information on classes, it&#8217;s ok, as long as the classes to which it writes some metadata are from the classloader, or any child classloader, of the Groovy runtime itself. Everything would be self-contained, meaning we would have a graph of objects that do not leak outside of the isolated classloader. However&#8230; Groovy uses Strings, integers, List, &#8230; all coming from the system classloader. And that is the main difference with the old metadata storage mechanism: the old one only <strong>referenced</strong> classes from the system classloader. With <code>ClassValue</code>, we are <strong>modifying</strong> classes from the system classloader too! That is, the String class, for example, contains in its class value map, information from the Groovy runtime! The famous <code>ClassInfo</code> instance is present there! There we are! We leaked a <code>ClassInfo</code> instance into the system classloader! So what happens is that when we are done with our "isolated" Groovy runtime, we think it should unload because nothing references any object or class from that classloader. However, the Groovy runtime did update classes from the system classloader, and it started leaking into it! The ghost in the shell! Groovy is spoiling everywhere&#8230;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So far so good, I had the explanation, I could write a workaround: let&#8217;s iterate over all those classes that Groovy updated, remove the <code>ClassInfo</code>, and we&#8217;re done. I wrote that code, and it turned out to be a bit ugly, but&#8230; it worked! Here is, for information, the cleanup code:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="prettyprint java language-java"><code>    static void removeClassFromGlobalClassSet(Class&lt;?&gt; classInfoClass) throws Exception {
        Field globalClassValueField = classInfoClass.getDeclaredField("globalClassValue");
        globalClassValueField.setAccessible(true);
        Object globalClassValue = globalClassValueField.get(null);
        Method removeFromGlobalClassValue = globalClassValueField.getType().getDeclaredMethod("remove", Class.class);
        removeFromGlobalClassValue.setAccessible(true);

        Field globalClassSetField = classInfoClass.getDeclaredField("globalClassSet");
        globalClassSetField.setAccessible(true);
        Object globalClassSet = globalClassSetField.get(null);
        globalClassSetField = globalClassSet.getClass().getDeclaredField("items");
        globalClassSetField.setAccessible(true);
        Object globalClassSetItems = globalClassSetField.get(globalClassSet);

        Field clazzField = classInfoClass.getDeclaredField("klazz");
        clazzField.setAccessible(true);


        Iterator it = (Iterator) globalClassSetItems.getClass().getDeclaredMethod("iterator").invoke(globalClassSetItems);

        while (it.hasNext()) {
            Object classInfo = it.next();
            Object clazz = clazzField.get(`ClassInfo`);
            removeFromGlobalClassValue.invoke(globalClassValue, clazz);
        }

    }</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After executing that code, no <code>ClassInfo</code> instance was leaking anymore into the system classloader, and the runtime could be shutdown properly. The garbage collector did its job, and yay! I&#8217;m so happy, I&#8217;ll be able to sleep soon! That was tuesday night. And that night, I thought I had found the solution.</p>

<h2 id="_memory_sensitive_classloader_caching">Memory sensitive classloader caching</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So wednesday, I spent the day trying to implement the same strategy inside Gradle. More precisely, inside the <code>IsolatedAntBuilder</code> thing I told you. I implemented the code, launched my test again and hurray! it worked! My test passed! No more PermGen space error! So all I had to do, now, was to reactivate classloader caching, otherwise, we would loose a feature that is important performance wise.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So I reactivated the cache, and boom! That time, the Gradle build did <strong>not</strong> fail with a PermGen error, but with very strange errors like this one:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>groovy.lang.MissingMethodException: No signature of method: java.lang.Integer.plus() is applicable for argument types: (java.lang.Integer) values: [0]
&gt;  Possible solutions: plus(java.lang.String), plus(java.lang.Character), abs(), use([Ljava.lang.Object;), split(groovy.lang.Closure), minus(java.lang.Character)</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Mmmmmm&#8230; 3rd "oh my!" moment of the week. I understood what I had just done. By clearing the <code>ClassInfo</code> stuff from the classloader, I had effectively shutdown the Groovy runtime that was initiated in that cached classloader. So when some code was trying to reuse the runtime from that cached classloader, since I had disabled it, it was failing! And there&#8217;s no option to reinitialize the Groovy runtime. It&#8217;s just not doable, because everything happens in static initializers (private final fields, &#8230;). So unless the JVM had an option to allow to re-execute the static initializers of a class (and who knows what oddities it would lead to), I had no luck.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That&#8217;s about when I told my mates at Gradle "I think we have to choose between caching and leaking memory". But the night came, and I actually had an idea. I could implement a memory sensitive cache: by writing a smart cache structure with appropriate SoftReferences and reference queues, I would be able to execute the shutdown code only when I know that the GC is trying to reclaim memory. The idea is simple: we have a map, which key is a SoftRefence&lt;String&gt;, and the value is our cached classloader. The Sterling represents the classpath that we are caching for the classloader.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now imagine that the GC is out of memory. The semantics of SoftReference are clear: before throwing an OutOfMemoryError, the JVM will do its best and clear all soft references. Doing so, using a custom reference queue, we can be notified that the reference is cleared. Then, we can execute the Groovy runtime shutdown code, which will in turn make the ClassLoader collectible.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Honestly I was pretty happy with my implementation. I executed the code and it worked! Caching was working until the GC tried to reclaim memory, then I saw my shutdow code executed, memory reclaimed and green tests. Woooo!!! I had eventually knocked that memory leak down! Ha ha!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then I remembered that my colleague Sterling had a test which involved a loop in an integration test. To make sure I had <strong>really</strong> fixed the leak, I asked him to tell me how he did that. The code was very simple, just involving a loop thanks to <code>@Unroll</code> in a <a href="https://docs.spockframework.org">Spock specification</a>. I did it and&#8230; PermGen error showed up again. WAT?!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That was the fourth "oh my!" moment. And not the last one. I really then spent hours in modifying my caching code, refactored my code to add more complicated memory leak strategies, seeing that there were still thread locals, clearing them explicitly, adding a memory leak strategy for Ant itself, for the Java Beans introspector, &#8230; None of my attempts worked. In the end, it always failed. But there was always one mystery: I saw that the Groovy classes were unloading. But the Ant classes were not&#8230; And the rest, I should have discovered that much sooner. But when you have so many potential source leaks, that are much more evident, it&#8217;s so hard to figure out.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In particular, one thing would have made things much easier to discover. In <a href="https://www.yourkit.com/features/">YourKit</a>, you can see that there are duplicate classes. Classes that have the same name, but come from different class loaders. However, there&#8217;s nothing that will <strong>show</strong> you those duplicates. You have to find them yourself. And in the end, when in the dump you see an instance of that class, all you can see is that it is an instance of <code>ClassInfo</code>. Nothing, visually, tells you that the instance of <code>ClassInfo</code> that you are seeing actually comes from a different classloader from the one you are seeing just next to it. A bit of color, for example, would help&#8230;. And it would have helped me seeing that some <code>ClassInfo</code> elements that I was seeing in the classes from Ant didn&#8217;t come from the "disposable" Groovy runtime&#8230; No. They were coming from&#8230; the Gradle runtime itself!</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ok, That was the last "oh my!" moment of the week. The one that killed all my hopes. And to understand the problem, I now have to explain to you how <code>IsolatedAntBuilder</code> works. It&#8217;s a very small, yet very smart and practical piece of code. Maybe too smart.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Gradle, as a core feature, lets you execute Ant tasks thanks to code inherited from the Groovy codebase itself: AntBuilder. It&#8217;s a very elegant piece of code, that lets you write things like:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="prettyprint groovy language-groovy"><code>task check &lt;&lt; {
    ant.taskdef(name: 'pmd',
                classname: 'net.sourceforge.pmd.ant.PMDTask',
                classpath: configurations.pmd.asPath)
    ant.pmd(shortFilenames: 'true',
            failonruleviolation: 'true',
            rulesetfiles: file('pmd-rules.xml').toURI().toString()) {
        formatter(type: 'text', toConsole: 'true')
        fileset(dir: 'src')
    }
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While this works, there&#8217;s actually a lot involved behind that. Including classloader magic. In particular, in the example above, we create a task definition in Ant, which uses a classpath defined in Gradle. "ant" here is a global object which is shared accross the build, but it is possible to avoid the classes from the Ant tasks to be mixed with the Gradle classpath itself by using antBuilder instead. That&#8217;s what the <a href="http://codenarc.sourceforge.net/">CodeNarc</a> plugin does:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="prettyprint groovy language-groovy"><code>antBuilder.withClasspath(classpath.asFiles).execute {
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>means "Gradle, please, create an isolated classloader for me, that will contain the classpath only necessary for CodeNarc, and execute that Ant task with it". It seems very trivial, but there is a problem. The code that you see here is found in a Gradle script. It means that the "antBuilder" object that you are seeing here comes from Gradle. It is our <code>IsolatedAntBuilder</code> instance. When we call "withClasspath", a new instance of <code>IsolatedAntBuilder</code> will be created, with an isolated classloader corresponding to the supplied classpath. Then calling execute with a closure that lets you configure the ant task using the Groovy AntBuilder syntax.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So the "Closure" class that we are seeing here comes from Gradle. Then, we have a classloader which contains the Ant runtime, and a "bridge" class, written in Groovy, called "AntBuilderDelegate", which has one responsibility: when the code of the Ant builder is going to be executed, it is likely that the version of Groovy which will be found on classpath will be <strong>different</strong> from the one that Gradle uses. That is exactly what happens with <a href="http://codenarc.sourceforge.net/">CodeNarc</a>: Gradle 2.6 uses Groovy 2.3.10, but the <a href="http://codenarc.sourceforge.net/">CodeNarc</a> plugin executes with Groovy 2.4.1, so the Ant task works with a different "Closure" class than the one that Gradle has. We will really have two distinct "Closure" classes here, and "AntBuilderDelegate" is responsible for filling the gap: when the Ant configuration code, which will use AntBuilder from the Ant classpath, is going to be executed, it will be calling AntBuilderDelegate instead of directly the Closure code. And that code will intercept the missing methods in order to "reroute" them to the builder. You don&#8217;t have to understand that in detail, it&#8217;s not really the point here, but it is important to understand that this "AntBuilderDelegate" class is instantiated&#8230; in Gradle, using the Gradle classloader.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now you may see it coming. I told you I had upgraded Gradle to use Groovy 2.4.4. So what does it mean? Gradle now uses Groovy with <code>ClassValue</code>. And what is the problem with <code>ClassValue</code>? All classes "touched" by Groovy will have them "polluted" with necessary metadata information. So when we create an instance of "AntBuilderDelegate", we&#8217;re doing that using the Groovy 2.4 runtime from Gradle, which comes with its own <code>ClassInfo</code>. And that delegate references and AntBuilder which is instantiated using the Ant classloader, with a different Groovy runtime, having its own <code>ClassInfo</code>. So what I had found earlier was that the <code>ClassInfo</code> from the Groovy "Ant" runtime was leaking into Gradle. But I hadn&#8217;t realized that the opposite was also true! By bridging the runtimes, we were leaking Groovy "Gradle" into the isolated classloader, through <code>ClassValue</code>!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, what happened, is that the Groovy classes from the isolated classpath were garbage collected, because no <code>ClassInfo</code> from Gradle leaked into them. However, the Ant classes were touched. And they were NOT collectible then.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And this is were I stopped. Because if I found a way to "unload" <code>ClassInfo</code> from the isolated classpath and the touched classes from the system classloader, I haven&#8217;t found a way to do the same for the <code>ClassInfo</code> instances that leak into the Ant runtime&#8230; Of course I tried a "brute force" thing, by removing all <code>ClassInfo</code> from those classes, but as you understood, it&#8217;s a desperate attempt: it&#8217;s equivalent to shutting down the runtime. And then, it totally breaks subsequent calls in the Gradle build, we&#8217;ve just broken the Groovy runtime from Gradle&#8230;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That&#8217;s were I felt desperate. After a week fighting those memory leaks, and so many "ah ah, got you!" moments, I was in front of a wall.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_what_s_next">What&#8217;s next?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, what can we do next? One has to remember that fixing Groovy is not the ultimate solution because Gradle uses Groovy internally, but the various tasks can very well use a different Groovy version which is beyond our control.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>rollback Groovy in Gradle to use Groovy 2.3.10. It would avoid the Groovy classes from Gradle to leak into the Isolated classloaders, but is also unfortunate given the improvements that this version provides. Also, those who write Groovy applications for Android use Groovy 2.4+&#8230;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://codenarc.sourceforge.net/">CodeNarc</a> would still use Groovy 2.4+, we could downgrade it too. However, if people rely on features of Groovy 2.4+, they just have no choice, so we would still have the problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use smarter techniques like instrumentation to track the leakages of <code>ClassInfo</code>, record them, and revert when we&#8217;re done. It&#8217;s doable, but it&#8217;s a huge amount of work, and relying on instrumentation for Gradle would be very bad for performance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Update Gradle to use FilteringClassLoader everywhere, including in its main process, to prevent <code>ClassValue</code> to be found. This would work because without that class, Groovy wouldn&#8217;t use <code>ClassValue</code> to store the metadata and fall back to the old mechanism.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wait for a fix in Groovy. Jochen is already working on that, but we know that the old mechanism isn&#8217;t perfect either, and has memory leaks too. That was one of the reasons to migrate to <code>ClassValue</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wait for a fix of the JVM. That&#8217;s beyond our control.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increase the PermGen space for builds that use the code quality plugins, which internally use AntBuilder. It&#8217;s what we do today. It works, but it&#8217;s just hiding the problem. And we have to explain to our users to do it too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some smart people come with a smart solution, that&#8217;s why I wrote this too. During that week, I got help from lots of people, including Jochen "Groovy" Theodorou, Henri "EasyMock" Tremblay, David Gageot or Nikita Salnikov from Plumbr, thank you guys!</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By the way, if you wonder, the same problem exist in JDK 8 too, it&#8217;s just not visible immediately because of the metaspace that appeared to replace the PermGen space.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, it was fun writing this "post-mortem", I hope it wasn&#8217;t too obscure, it helped me a lot because I had so many "got it" and "oh noes!" moments that I felt it was very interesting to share this story with you. And if you like technical challenges, do not forget that <a href="https://gradle.org/gradle-jobs/">Gradle is hiring</a>!</p>

<p>One of the most current uses cases of Groovy is scripting. Groovy makes it very easy to execute code dynamically, at runtime. Depending
on the application, scripts can be found in multiple sources: file system, databases, remote services, &#8230; but more importantly, the
designer of the application which executes scripts is not necessarily the one writing those scripts. Moreover, the scripts might run in a
constrained environment (limited memory, file descriptors, time, &#8230;) or your you simply don&#8217;t want to allow users to access the full
capabilities of the language from a script.</p>
</div>
<div class="openblock INFO"><div class="title">What you will learn in this post</div>
<div class="content">
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>why Groovy is a good fit to write internal DSLs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>what it implies in terms of security in your applications</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>how you can customize compilation to improve the DSL</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the meaning of <code>SecureASTCustomizer</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>what are type checking extensions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>how you can rely on type checking extensions to offer proper sandboxing</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, imagine that you want to offer users the ability to evaluate mathematical expressions. One option would be to implement your
own internal DSL, create a parser and eventually an interpreter for those expressions. Obviously this involves a bit of work, but if in
the end you need to improve performance, for example by generating bytecode for the expressions instead of evaluating them, or introduce
caching of those runtime generated classes, then Groovy is probably a very good option.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are lots of options available, described in the <a href="http://docs.groovy-lang.org/latest/html/documentation/index.html#_integrating_groovy_in_a_java_application">documentation</a>
but the most simple example is just using the <code>Eval</code> class:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="title">Example.java</div>
<div class="content">
<pre class="prettyprint java language-java"><code>int sum = (Integer) Eval.me("1+1");</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The code <code>1+1</code> is parsed, compiled to bytecode, loaded and eventually executed by Groovy at runtime. Of course in this example the code is very simple, and you will want to
add parameters, but the idea is that the code which is executed here is arbitrary. This is probably not what you want. For a calculator, you want to allow expressions like:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="prettyprint groovy language-groovy"><code>1+1
x+y
1+(2*x)**y
cos(alpha)*r
v=1+x</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>but certainly not</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="prettyprint groovy language-groovy"><code>println 'Hello'
(0..100).each { println 'Blah' }
Pong p = new Pong()
println(new File('/etc/passwd').text)
System.exit(-1)
Eval.me('System.exit(-1)') // a script within a script!</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is where things start to become complicated, and where we start seeing actually multiple needs:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>restricting the grammar of the language to a subset of its capabilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>preventing users from executing unexpected code</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>preventing users from executing malicious code</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The calculator example is pretty simple, but for more complex DSLs, people might actually start writing problematic code without noticing, especially if the DSL is suffiently elegant to be used
by <em>non developers</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I was in this situation a few years ago, when I designed an engine that used Groovy "scripts" written by linguists. One of the problems was that they could unintentionally create infinite loops,
for example. Code was executing on the server, and then you had a thread eating 100% of the CPU and had no choice but restart the application server so I had to find a way to mitigate that
problem without compromising the DSL nor the tooling or the performance of the application.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Actually, lots of people have similar needs. During the past 4 years, I spoke to tons of users who had a similar question: <em>How can I prevent users from doing bad things in Groovy scripts?</em></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_compilation_customizers">Compilation customizers</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At that time, I had implemented my own solution, but I knew that other people also had implemented similar ones. In the end, Guillaume Laforge
suggested to me that I wrote something that would help fixing those issues and make into Groovy core. This happened in Groovy 1.8.0 with
<a href="http://docs.groovy-lang.org/latest/html/documentation/index.html#compilation-customizers">compilation customizers</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Compilation customizers are a set of classes that are aimed at tweaking the compilation of Groovy scripts. You can write your own customizer but Groovy ships with:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>an import customizer, which aims at adding imports transparently to scripts, so that users do not have to add "import" statements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) transformation customizer, which allows to add AST transformations transparently to scripts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a secure AST customizer, which aims at restricting the grammar and syntactical constructs of the language</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The AST transformation customizer allowed me to solve the infinite loop issue, by applying the <a href="http://docs.groovy-lang.org/latest/html/gapi/groovy/transform/ThreadInterrupt.html">@ThreadInterrupt</a>
transformation, but the <a href="http://docs.groovy-lang.org/latest/html/api/org/codehaus/groovy/control/customizers/SecureASTCustomizer.html">SecureASTCustomizer</a> is probably the one which has
been the most misinterpreted of the whole.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I must apologize for this. Back then, I had no better name in mind. The important part of SecureASTCustomizer is <strong>AST</strong>. It was aimed at restricting access to some features of the AST. The
"secure" part is actually not a good name at all, and I will illustrate why. You can even find a blog post from Kohsuke Kawagushi, of Jenkins fame, named
Groovy SecureASTCustomizer is harmful[<a href="http://kohsuke.org/2012/04/27/groovy-secureastcustomizer-is-harmful/">http://kohsuke.org/2012/04/27/groovy-secureastcustomizer-is-harmful/</a>]. It is very true. The SecureASTCustomizer has never been designed with sandboxing
in mind. It was designed to restrict the language at compile time, not runtime. So a much better name, in retrospect, would have been <em>GrammarCustomizer</em>. But as you&#8217;re certainly aware, there
are two hard things in computer science: cache invalidation, naming things and off by one errors.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So imagine that you think of the secure AST customizer as a way of securing your script, and that you want to use this to prevent a user from calling <code>System.exit</code> from a script. The
documentation says that you can prevent calls on some specific receivers by defining either a blacklist or a whitelist. In terms of securing something, I would always recommand to use a
whitelist, that is to say to list explicitly what is allowed, rather than a blacklist, saying what is disallowed. The reason is that hackers always think of things you don&#8217;t, so let&#8217;s illustrate
this.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here is how a naive "sandbox" script engine could be configured using the <code>SecureASTCustomizer</code>. I am writing the examples of configuration in Java, even though I could write them in Groovy, just
to make the difference between the integration code and the scripts clear.</p>

<p>This is the result of the application of the secure AST customizer, which prevents the execution of methods on the <code>System</code> class. Success! Now we have secured our script! Oh wait&#8230;</p>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_secureastcustomizer_pwned">SecureASTCustomizer pwned!</h2>

<p>Secure you say? So what if I do:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="prettyprint groovy language-groovy"><code>def c = System

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Execute again and you will see that the program exits <strong>without</strong> error and <strong>without</strong> printing the result. The return code of the process is -1, which indicates that the user script has been executed!
What happened? Basically, at compile time, the secure AST customizer is not able to recognize that <code>c.exit</code> is a call on <code>System</code>, because it works at the AST level! It analyzes a method call, and
in this case the method call is <code>c.exit(-1)</code>, then gets the receiver and checks if the receiver is in the whitelist (or blacklist). In this case, the receiver is <code>c</code> and this variable is <strong>declared
with def</strong>, which is equivalent to declaring it as <code>Object</code>, so it will think that <code>c</code> is <code>Object</code>, not <code>System</code>!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Actually there are <strong>many</strong> ways to workaround the various configurations that you can make on the secure AST customizer. Just for fun, a few of them:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="prettyprint groovy language-groovy"><code>((Object)System).exit(-1)
Class.forName('java.lang.System').exit(-1)
('java.lang.System' as Class).exit(-1)

import static java.lang.System.exit
exit(-1)</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>and there are <strong>much</strong> more options. The dynamic nature of Groovy just makes it impossible to resolve those cases at compile time. There are solutions though. One option is to rely on the JVM standard
security manager. However this is a system wide solution which is often considered as a hammer. But it also doesn&#8217;t really work for all cases, for example you might not want to prevent creation of
files, but only reads for example&#8230;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This limitation - or should I say frustration for lots of us - led several people to create a solution based on <strong>runtime checks</strong>. Runtime checks do not suffer the same problem, because you
will have for example the actual receiver type of a message before checking if a method call is allowed or not. In particular, those implementations are of particular interest:</p>

<p>However none of those implementations is totally secure or reliable. For example, the version by Kohsuke relies on hacking the internal implementation of call site caching. The problem is that it is
not compatible with the invokedynamic version of Groovy, and those internal classes are going to be removed in future versions of Groovy. The version by Simon, on the other hand, relies on AST transformations
but misses a lot of possible hacks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a result, with friends of mine Corinne Krych, Fabrice Matrat and Sébastien Blanc, we decided to create a new runtime sandboxing mechanism that would not have the issues of those projects. We started
implementing this during a hackathon in Nice, and <a href="http://greachconf.com/speakers/fabrice-matrat-cedric-champeau-groovy-head-in-the-cloud/">we gave a talk about this last year</a> at the Greach conference.
It relies on AST transformations and heavily rewrites the code in order to perform a check before each method call, property access, increment of variable, binary expression, &#8230;
The <a href="https://github.com/rivieragug/groovy-core/tree/secureruntime">implementation</a> is still incomplete, and not much work has been done because I realized there was still a problem in case
of methods or properties called on "implicit this", like in builders for example:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="prettyprint groovy language-groovy"><code>xml {
   cars {				 // cars is a method call on an implicit this: "this".cars(...)
     car(make:'Renault', model: 'Clio')
   }
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As of today I still didn&#8217;t find a way to properly handle this because of the design of the meta-object protocol in Groovy, that here relies on the fact that a receiver throws an exception when the method
is not found before trying another receiver. In short, it means that you cannot know the type of the receiver before the method is actually called. And if it is called, it&#8217;s already too late&#8230;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Until earlier this year I had still no perfect solution to this problem, in case the script being executed is using the dynamic features of the language. But now has come the time to explain how you can
significantly improve the situation if you are ready to loose some of the dynamism of the language.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s come back to the root problem of the SecureASTCustomizer: it works on the abstract syntax tree and has no knowledge of the concrete types of the receivers of messages. But since Groovy 2, Groovy has
optional compilation, and in Groovy 2.1, we added <a href="http://docs.groovy-lang.org/latest/html/documentation/#_type_checking_extensions">type checking extensions</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Type checking extensions are very powerful: they allow the designer of a Groovy DSL to help the compiler infer types, but it also lets you throw compilation errors when normally it should not. Type
checking extensions are even used internally in Groovy to support the static compiler, for example to implement traits or the
<a href="http://docs.groovy-lang.org/latest/html/documentation/markup-template-engine.html">markup template engine</a>.</p>

<p>What if, instead of relying on the information available after parsing, we could rely on information from the type checker? Take the following code that our hacker tried to write:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="prettyprint groovy language-groovy"><code>((Object)System).exit(-1)</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you activate type checking, this code would not compile:</p>

<div class="listingblock">

[Static type checking] - Cannot find matching method java.lang.Object#exit(java.lang.Integer). Please check if the declared type is right and if the method exists.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So this code would not compile anymore. But what if the code is:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="prettyprint groovy language-groovy"><code>def c = System
c.exit(-1)</code></pre>
</div>
</div>

<p>You can verify that this passes type checking by wrapping the code into a method and running the script with the <code>groovy</code> command line tool:</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then the type checker will recognize that the <code>exit</code> method is called on the <code>System</code> class and is valid. It will not help us there. But what we know, if this code passes type checking, is that the
compiler recognized the call on the <code>System</code> receiver. The idea, then, is to rely on a type checking extension to disallow the call.</p>

<p>So this time, thanks to the type checker, <code>c</code> is really recognized as an instance of class <code>System</code> and we can really disallow the call. This is a very simple example, but it doesn&#8217;t really go as
far as what we can do with the secure AST customizer in terms of configuration. The extension that we wrote has <strong>hardcoded</strong> checks, but it would probably be nicer if we could configure it. So let&#8217;s
start working with a bit more complex example.</p>

<p>So far, our script works, but nothing prevents a hacker from executing malicious code. Since we want to use type checking, I would recommand to use the <code>@CompileStatic</code> transformation

<p>What happened? If you read the script from a "compiler" point of view, it doesn&#8217;t know anything about the "score" variable. <strong>You</strong>, as a developer, know that it&#8217;s a variable
of type <code>double</code>, but the compiler cannot infer it. This is precisely what type checking extensions are designed for: you can provide additional information to the compiler,
so that compilation passes. In this case, we will want to indicate that the <code>score</code> variable is of type <code>double</code>.</p>

<p>Dealing with properties is a bit more complicated because the type checker doesn&#8217;t have a handler for "property selection" like it does

a type checking extension which is not written exactly as you have seen in this blog post, because it is meant to be precompiled

<h2 id="_conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This post has explored the interest of using Groovy as a platform for scripting on the JVM. It introduced various mechanisms for integration, and showed that this
comes at the price of security. However, we illustrated some concepts like compilation customizers that make it easier to sandbox the environment of execution of
scripts. The current list of customizers available in the Groovy distribution, and the currently available sandboxing projects in the wild, are not sufficient
to guarantee security of execution of scripts in the general case (dependending, of course, on your users and where the scripts come from).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We then illustrated how you could, if you are ready to pay the price of loosing some of the dynamic features of the language, properly workaround those limitations
through type checking extensions. Those type checking extensions are so powerful that you can even introduce your own error messages during the compilation of
scripts. Eventually, by doing this and caching your scripts, you will also benefit from dramatic performance improvements in script execution.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Eventually, the sandboxing mechanism that we illustrated is <strong>not</strong> a replacement for the <code>SecureASTCustomizer</code>. We recommand that you actually use <strong>both</strong>, because they
work on different levels: the secure AST customizer will work on the grammar level, allowing you to restrict some language constructs (for example preventing the
creation of closures or classes inside the script), while the type checking extension will work after type inference (allowing you to reason on inferred types
rather than declared types).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Last but not least, the solution that I described here is incomplete. It is not available in Groovy core. As I will have less time to work on Groovy, I would be very
glad if someone or some people improve this solution and make a pull request so that we can have something!</p>

<p>With all the changes that the Groovy project is seeing since the beginning of the year, I thought it was a good time to
make a summary about its history. In particular, with the <a href="http://blog.pivotal.io/pivotal/news-2/groovy-2-4-and-grails-3-0-to-be-last-major-releases-under-pivotal-sponsorship">end of sponsorship from Pivotal</a>, as well as
<a href="http://restlet.com/blog/2015/03/02/head-of-groovy-project-joins-restlet-to-lead-api-development-tools/">Guillaume Laforge annoucing he is joining Restlet</a>, a lot of people state that Groovy is done. It will be the occasion to talk about
the history of the project, both in terms of community and sponsorship.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First of all, Groovy is, and will remain, alive. Groovy is a community project and we are pleased to announce that <strong><a href="http://glaforge.appspot.com/article/groovy-projects-intends-to-join-the-apache-software-foundation">Groovy
has started the process to join the Apache Software Foundation</a></strong>. The community deserved it, and even if it will mean some adaptations on
our side, we think that the <a href="http://apache.org">ASF</a> will be a great fit for the project.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To build the statistics you will read in this post, I have used a <a href="https://github.com/melix/blog/blob/master/src/jbake/content/2015/02/commit-stats.groovy">Groovy script</a> (of course!) that
takes as reference the number of commits. This is far from being a perfect number, because some commits are just
for fixing typos, while others are full new features and it also totally misses the fact that patches, before Git, didn&#8217;t carry the author
information or the problem that we maintain multiple branches
of Groovy, requiring a lot of work, but it gives an idea&#8230; And because people think that end of sponsorship
may be equivalent to death, I separated commits in two categories: sponsored and community. Sponsored commits are commits
which are likely to have been made by someone directly paid to contribute on Groovy. We will see how this proportion evolved
over time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you think Groovy is dead, please read the following carefully. Let&#8217;s start our journey back in time!</p>

<p>2003 is the inception year of Groovy. <strong>James Strachan</strong>, in August 2003, wanted to create a dynamic language for the JVM, inspired by Ruby,
but closer to Java. Groovy was born, and the idea never changed over time: Groovy is the perfect companion for Java, a language which can
be very close to Java in terms of syntax but also removes a lot of its boilerplate. Bob McWhirter is a famous name in the JVM world, he is
now Director of Polyglot at Red Hat, so you can see that when he started contributing to the language back then, there was already a story
for him! Sam Pullara is another very smart guy in the JVM world and he worked for top companies like BEA, Yahoo! or Twitter to name a few.
He is a technical reviewer for the JavaOne conference.</p>

<p>I would tend to think that 2005 is the year when Jochen Theodorou took the technical lead of Groovy. In 2005, he becomes the most prolific contributor,
even beyond the creator of the language himself. Dierk Koenig makes an appearance here: he is known for his work on <a href="http://gpars.codehaus.org/">GPars</a>, but also for the reference book for Groovy: <a href="http://www.manning.com/koenig2/">Groovy in Action</a>.</p>

<p>2006 is a very calm year for Groovy in terms of code production. James, the creator of the language, already disappeared from the contributors, and will not contribute anymore. <strong>Guillaume Laforge</strong>, in agreement with the other contributors, <strong>takes the project lead</strong> (he is still the lead today).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With half as many commits as in 2007, in retrospect, I would say that this was a critical year: either the project would die, or it would have become what it is today. And my personal feeling is that the person who saved Groovy just appeared in the contributors list: Paul King. <strong>Paul is undoubtfully the most active contributor to Groovy</strong>. He wrote a lot of the Groovy Development Kit, that is to say the APIs without which a language would be nothing. Having a nice language is one thing, having proper APIs and libraries that unleash its full potential is another. Paul King did it. Look at his ranking here: 3rd place. You will never see him ranked lower than that. And guess what? Paul is <strong>not</strong> paid to do this. He <a href="http://www.asert.com.au/">runs his own business</a> and if you want to work with a Groovy expert, he&#8217;s probably the best.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Joachim Baumann is a name some people would recognize: he is still working with Groovy and one of the most regular contributors, with the Windows installer. Joachim takes time, for each Groovy release, to produce a Windows installer, which today we are still not capable of handling automatically.</p>

<p>2007 is an important year in the history of Groovy. On January, 2d, Groovy 1.0 is out. <strong>Paul King ranks #1 for the first time, and will
remain on top for a long time</strong>. This year also sees the creation of G2One, the first company build specifically for Groovy and Grails, by Guillaume
Laforge, Graeme Rocher and Alex Tkachman. Both Graeme and Alex make their first appearance in the contributors graph, and both of them made
significant contributions to the Groovy ecosystem: Graeme is famous for co-creating the Grails framework, and is still the lead of the project,
while Alex is the one who contributed major performance improvements to the Groovy runtime (call site caching) and first experimented with
a static compiler for Groovy (Groovy++).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Danno Ferrin contributed what is still one of my personal favorite features of Groovy, AST transformations, and probably one of the reasons
I got paid to work on Groovy so thank you Danno! Andrés Almiray,
listed here for the first time, is famous for the <a href="http://griffon.codehaus.org/">Griffon</a> framework, a Grails-like framework for desktop applications which is still
actively developed. He spent a lot of time improving the Swing support in Groovy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Starting from 2007, you will see that the <em>sponsored</em> ratio of commits is changing. People who were employed by G2One fall into that category. As you
can see, 2007 is more than important for Groovy, it is its second birth. And to conclude that, Groovy won the first prize at JAX 2007 innovation award.</p>

<p>In 2008, <strong>Paul King still ranks #1</strong> and you can see that the people who were sponsored by G2One were actually not the main contributors. Actually, most
of them did consulting to pay salaries, which doesn&#8217;t leave much time to contribute to the language. Hopefully, a great project such as Groovy can rely
on its community! Guillaume, Graeme and Alex were looking for an opportunity to spend more time on actual development, and it happened in November 2008

<p>2009 is another important year concluding with the release of Groovy 1.7, the first version of Groovy supporting inner classes
or the famous power asserts from Peter Niederwieser. If you know Groovy, you must know Peter, the father of the famous Spock testing
framework which <a href="http://groovy.329449.n5.nabble.com/Ann-Spock-1-0-has-been-released-td5722915.html">just reached 1.0</a>!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Hamlet D&#8217;Arcy contributed a lot in terms of code quality</strong>, but also became the first specialist of AST transformations. 2009 is also the year I started to use Groovy, as a user. I never stopped and actually I started contributing back
then. At that time, Groovy was still using Subversion (we&#8217;re now using Git like all the cool kids), so it was the good old patch way,
loosing authorship.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This year is also the year when James Strachan wrote a very famous quote about Groovy. This quote is probably the most innapropriately
used quote about Groovy of all time, because it was done by its creator, but remember that James left the project in 2005!</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
I can honestly say if someone had shown me the Programming in Scala book by Martin Odersky, Lex Spoon &amp; Bill Venners back in 2003 I&#8217;d probably have never created Groovy.

<p>First of all James says nothing about the language itself here. He had already left the project and says that <strong>if</strong> he had known about Scala before, he <strong>wouldn&#8217;t</strong> have created Groovy. I am today very happy that he didn&#8217;t know about it, or we would have missed an incredibly powerful language. Groovy today
is <strong>nothing close</strong> to what it was when James left the project, thanks to the lead of Guillaume Laforge and incredibly talented people like Paul King, Jochen Theodorou and all the contributors listed on this page. Groovy and Scala both have their communities, but also different use cases. I wouldn&#8217;t sell one for the other&#8230;</p>

<p>2010 is a pretty stable year for Groovy. Groovy reaches 1.8 in 2010 with important features for its incredible DSL design capabilities. With command chain expressions, native JSON support and performance improvements, Groovy put the bar very high in terms of integration in the Java ecosystem. Today, <strong>no other JVM language is as simple as Groovy to integrate with Java</strong>. With cross-compilation and by the use of the very same class model, Groovy is at that date the best language for scripting on the JVM. It is so good that a lot of people start to see it as a better Java and want to use it as a first class language. However, being dynamic, Groovy is still a problem for a category of users&#8230;</p>

<p>In 2011, I became a committer to the Groovy project. As I said, I had contributed several fixes or features for Groovy 1.8, but for the first time, I became a committer and I started to be able to push changes to the codebase without having to ask permission. So this is basically the first time you see my name on the contributors list, but you can see that I am ranking #1 and I have never lost that ranking since then. It surprised me too, but there is a very good reason for that. In october 2011, in addition to being a committer, I also became paid to work on Groovy. Full-time. <strong>I entered the club of lucky people being paid to work on open-source software</strong>. It was sincerely a dream, and I will never be enough thankful to Guillaume Laforge for giving me this opportunity. He changed my life and I <em>think</em> I became a better developer thanks to him. VMware was my employer back then, and while I had never worked on a language before, Guillaume trusted my skills and proposed to me to work on something that would dramatically change the language : a static type checker.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I also worked on the infrastructure of the language, starting from the migration to GitHub. It was an important move to make: as you can see, there was a very limited set of committers to Groovy. With <a href="https://github.com/groovy/groovy-core/">GitHub</a>, we had the tool we needed to increase the size of our community and from the numbers that will follow, I think it&#8217;s a success.</p>

<p>2012 is one of the most important years for the language. It was the year Groovy 2.0 was released. As you can see, I am still ranking #1 and Paul King, an unpaid contributor, is #2. This tells you the importance of community! Groovy 2 is a major change in the language, because it introduced both optional type checking and static compilation. For the first time, Groovy was able to provide at compile time the same level of feedback that Java would have. Some people wanted to kill me for having introduced that into the language. The truth is that it wasn&#8217;t my decision, but in retrospect, I am very happy with what the language is now. Without this, some people would have abandonned Groovy in favor of other JVM languages like Scala, while now in Groovy you can have the same level of performance as Java, with type safety, powerful type inference, extension methods, functional style programming and without the boilerplate. And it&#8217;s optional. I don&#8217;t know any other language that allows this, especially when you take type checking extensions into account, a feature that allows Groovy to go far beyond what Java and other languages offer in terms of type safety or static compilation.</p>

<p>While continuing to improve Groovy, 2013 was very important for the community. You can start to see the GitHub effect here, with <strong>much</strong> more contributors than before. It is impressive to see the difference before 2011 and after. The number of contributors is continously growing. In 2013, 63% of commits came from the community!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In February 2013, we also launched a new big project: the documentation and website overhaul. It is incredible to think that this effort is still uncomplete, but if you see that the old wiki has more than a thousand page or contents (often outdated), you can imagine what effort it takes to rewrite the documentation. Hopefully, we&#8217;re close to filling the gap now, and with the demise of Codehaus, we officially launched our <a href="http://groovy-lang.org">new website</a> where you can see the result of this job.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I also started working on Android support during 2013, for a first overview in GR8Conf 2014, and continued working on improving the infrastructure, with Bintray, TeamCity and Gradle. And Pivotal was born, out of EMC and VMware. Groovy and Grails, along with the Spring Framework, became part of this new company which is still paying me today to work on Groovy (and I, we, should be very thankful for this).</p>

<p>2014 was a difficult year. We had a lot of work to do on the documentation side, new features to deliver (traits) and an important topic we definitely wanted to highlight: Android support. This took longer than expected, but in the end, the new <a href="http://beta.groovy-lang.org/releasenotes/groovy-2.4.html">Groovy 2.4</a>. We&#8217;re lucky to have half of the commits coming from the community here. Especially, lots of people helped us on the documentation. And it wasn&#8217;t easy, because our documentation requires that every snippet of code that appears in the docs belongs to a unit test, to make sure that the documentation is always up-to-date.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Meanwhile, at the end of the year, we learnt from Pivotal that they would end sponsoring our jobs. It means that Guillaume Laforge, Jochen Theodorou and myself, for the Groovy team, plus Graeme Rocher, Jeff Brown and Lari Hotari, for the Grails team, were both loosing their jobs and full time to work on the project at the same time. This wasn&#8217;t really a surprise and I am very happy I could work for so long on Groovy, full time, but as I said in a previous post I also wish I will still be able to do that, because you can see from the numbers and features that it matters. If you wonder, we are still discussing with several potential sponsors.</p>

<p>2015 will be another important year. It&#8217;s going to be huge for the community. Guillaume Laforge announced that he was joining Restlet, so for the first time since 2007 he will not be fully employed to work on Groovy, but I don&#8217;t expect this to have a big impact on the language development itself: as you can see from the numbers, about half of the commits already come from the community and Guillaume didn&#8217;t contribute much code lately. He was instead the lead of the project, the one that took decisions, the one speaking about the project and talking to and leading the community. He was the voice. It was a hard job, a very important one for Groovy. Guillaume is still today the lead of the project, and he will continue to contribute to the language, but I know from him that he wanted to be able to do more code, and put Groovy in action into a new project.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With the <a href="http://blog.pivotal.io/pivotal/news-2/groovy-2-4-and-grails-3-0-to-be-last-major-releases-under-pivotal-sponsorship">end of sponsorship of Pivotal</a>, the <a href="http://www.codehaus.org/">demise of Codehaus</a> and <a href="http://restlet.com/blog/2015/03/02/head-of-groovy-project-joins-restlet-to-lead-api-development-tools/">Guillaume&#8217;s decision</a>, it became even more important to move Groovy to a foundation where it will be able to live with or without us. I have honestly no idea where I will work in a few weeks now. I sincerely hope I will still be able to contribute to the language full time, but let&#8217;s be clear: today, it is very unlikely this is going to happen. It makes it very important for the project to be able to develop the community even more. We had more than 4.5 million downloads last year. This is huge. And with Android support, I see a lot of potential, even if we have tough competition with other languages and people being paid to develop them. The <strong><a href="http://apache.org">Apache Software Foundation</a> is going to help us with securing the future of the language and building a community</strong>. I am proud of what you have done, collectively, and this is not over. Groovy is ready for a rebirth under the Apache umbrella!</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There we are. January 19th was a bad day as Pivotal <a href="http://blog.pivotal.io/pivotal/news-2/groovy-2-4-and-grails-3-0-to-be-last-major-releases-under-pivotal-sponsorship">announced that they wouldn&#8217;t sponsor the development of the Groovy language</a>, as well as its long time friend the Grails framework, starting from march 31st. As I was paid to work on Groovy, it has a direct consequence for me: starting from April 1st, I am <strong>for hire</strong>. For you, it probably doesn&#8217;t change much as Groovy and Grails existed before Pivotal without corporate funding.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It was hard to keep this secret for weeks, but now that everything is public, it is easier for us. I have been lucky to work full time on the Groovy language for a bit more than 3 years now. Lucky because it was both a great open-source software and my passion. I have implemented major features of the language <a href="https://github.com/groovy/groovy-core/graphs/contributors">since Groovy 1.8</a>: static type checking, static compilation, Android support, numerous AST transformations, continous integration&#8230; I have given talks to various conferences, including world class ones like JavaOne, Devoxx, GR8Conf or SpringOne2GX and it was a fantastic opportunity that wouldn&#8217;t have been possible without the support from VMware then Pivotal.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However I feel that <strong>I still have a lot to do</strong>. So many things are on the list, so much to improve, like for example adding language support for asynchronous programming, improved Java 8 support, a new meta-object protocol, not forgetting, of course, bugfixes&#8230; I am 100% convinced that the language wouldn&#8217;t have reached the level of maturity it has without support from a company like Pivotal. And even though Java is considered mature, it doesn&#8217;t mean that the language shouldn&#8217;t continue to evolve: it is rather the opposite. People are constantly asking for evolutions, because programming models evolve too.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For those reasons, my #1 choice would be to find a new company securing the development of Groovy and Grails, that is to say willing to pay me and my mates to continue working on them. The Groovy community is huge, there are lots of companies using Groovy in a variety of domains, I sincerely hope this is possible. With more than 4 million downloads in 2014, I can&#8217;t imagine how many hours of development have been saved thanks to Groovy and Grails&#8230; Should you be interested in sponsoring our projects, please write to <a href="mailto:sponsorship@groovy-lang.org">sponsorship@groovy-lang.org</a>.</p>

<p>If unfortunately we can&#8217;t find third parties willing to take over the development of the language and hire us, then I would obviously be available to help you in your projects. For those of you who are looking for someone with a good knowledge of the JVM internals, I am listening. My areas of interest:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>R&amp;D</strong>: innovation, technical challenges are what drive my motivation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>open-source</strong> over closed-source: If you are an Open-Source company, by that I mean a company which contributes Open-Source, I think we are on the same line. I love to share what I do and I am convinced that open-source development is the best way to improve the global quality of a project. I have worked on closed-source software in the past, there are good reasons to do so but working on OSS software is really what I prefer. I also enjoy <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/melix/">speaking publicly</a> about projects I work on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>JVM</strong>: I have spent most of my career on that platform and believe me, it&#8217;s not dead :)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>back-end</strong> over front-end: I love working on tooling, performance tuning, algorithmics&#8230; everything that is hidden to the end user. On the other side I am not so good on the front-end part (HTML, CSS, &#8230;) so it would probably not be a good idea to make me work on that topic :)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>remote working</strong>: I live in Saint Hilaire de Loulay, a small countryside town near Nantes, in France. I have now been working from home for more that 3 years, most of the Spring Framework team works that way, and it has been very successful so far. If you are not against the idea, I would love to continue that way.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In any case if you think a profile like mine is interesting for your company, you can contact me or ask for my résumé at <a href="mailto:cedric.champeau@gmail.com">cedric.champeau@gmail.com</a>. Meanwhile, rest assured that we are focused and we will soon release Groovy 2.4 to prove that!</p>
