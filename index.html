<p>Goodbye JRoller, welcome GitHub! Eventually, I migrated my blog to <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub pages</a>. It is a now a statically generated website.
What is interesting here is how I migrated contents from my <a href="http://jroller.com/melix">old blog</a>. I used a <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org">Groovy</a> script which
downloaded the old pages, converted them into <a href="http://asciidoctor.org">Asciidoctor</a> format so that they can be statically processed by <a href="http://jbake.org">JBake</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Should you need something similar, I pushed this little toy here: <a href="https://github.com/melix/jroller-export">https://github.com/melix/jroller-export</a></p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now the export is quite raw, there are probably minor rendering issues to fix, or broken links, and I still have to integrate:</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For some time now, I’ve started using <a href="http://imakewebthings.com/deck.js/">deck.js</a> to write my talks. One of the reasons I do this is that it saves me <strong>lots</strong> of time when I have to copy and paste code, because I can rely on javascript code highlighting libraries to do the job. I can focus on contents instead of rendering. If I had a better knowledge of CSS, too, I could certainly write impressive presentations (but unfortunately, no, I’m not good at CSS).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The problem with HTML5 slideshows is that you are often asked to upload your slides as PDF. For example, <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/">SpeakerDeck</a>, <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/">SlideShare</a> or <a href="http://www.parleys.com/">Parleys</a> all require you to upload slides as PDF. None of them supports HTML5 (which is understandable because there are many frameworks available). While I did find some libraries that did the job (often in Perl or Ruby), I never managed to find one that actually worked properly.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_deck2pdf">Deck2pdf</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That’s where it all started. I knew that JavaFX2 provided a WebView, which allowed rendering HTML pages with WebKit. What if I could use it to render my slide deck and export it to PDF? <a href="https://github.com/melix/deck2pdf">deck2pdf was born!</a>. I started with something that was able to export my <a href="http://imakewebthings.com/deck.js/">deck.js</a> presentations, but I figured out very quickly that it could support other HTML5 presentation libraries quite easily. As of today, <a href="https://github.com/melix/deck2pdf">deck2pdf</a> supports:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://imakewebthings.com/deck.js/">deck.js</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js">reveal.js</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://bartaz.github.io/impress.js">impress.js</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and <a href="https://github.com/paulrouget/dzslides">DZSlides</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But more importantly, if your favorite HTML5 slideware is not supported, adding custom profiles is supported and fairly easy! Adding support for another library is as simple as adding a descriptor file with the javascript commands inside. For example, here’s how the <a href="http://imakewebthings.com/deck.js/">deck.js</a> profile is written:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>totalSlides=$.deck('getSlides').length
nextSlide=$.deck('next')
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That’s all! Support for more complex interactions is also provided using Groovy profiles, like for example in <a href="http://bartaz.github.io/impress.js">impress.js</a>:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>setup = {
    js 'var api = impress();'
    js '''var $$ = function ( selector, context ) {
        context = context || document;
        return context.querySelectorAll(selector);
    };'''
    js '''var byId = function ( id ) {
        return document.getElementById(id);
    };'''
}

nextSlide = {
    js('api.next()')
}

totalSlides = {
    js (/$$(".step", byId('impress')).length/)
}

// longer pause because of transitions
pause = 2000
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Last week I spoke at <a href="http://gr8conf.eu/index">GR8Conf Europe</a> for the second time. As last year, the content of the conference was really amazing and highly technical. While the conference started with a University day on May, 22, we took advantage of the conference to organize a Groovy DevCon the day before. A Groovy DevCon is basically a physical meeting for the Groovy Core developers, where we share ideas and eventually make decisions with regards to the future of Groovy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This year, several well-known Groovy gurus participated in the meeting:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/glaforge">Guillaume Laforge</a>, the Groovy project lead</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>http://[Jochen &#8220;Blackdrag&#8221; Theodorou], the Groovy technical lead</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/mittie">Dierk Koenig</a>, Groovy committer and main author of the famous Groovy in action book</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/aalmiray">Andrés Almiray</a>, the Griffon lead</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/CedricChampeau">myself</a>, Groovy Core committer</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But we had a special guest, <a href="http://gr8conf.eu/Speakers/Juergen-Hoeller">M. Juergen Hoeller of Spring fame</a> himself!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The meeting was really useful. On my side, I was particularily happy with the discussions regarding Groovy and Java 8, where we eventually took the (long awaited for me) decision to provide some automatic coercion of closures to interfaces. Basically, this means that you would no longer have to write:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>    interface Callback {
        void execute()
    }
    void onEvent(Callback c) { c.execute() }

    onEvent({println 'hello'} as Callback)
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But instead, you will be able to write directly:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>    interface Callback {
        void execute()
    }
    void onEvent(Callback c) { c.execute() }

    onEvent {println 'hello'}
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This will lead to easier to read and maintain code. We discussed some limitations for the feature, but for a large number of cases, this would work directly. You can expect this feature to appear in Groovy 2.2.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The University day was the occasion for me to give a workshop about AST transformations. For GR8Conf Europe, I had the chance to do it with <a href="http://twitter.com/aalmiray">Andrés Almiray</a>, the Griffon lead, but also one of the most talented programmer of the Java community. Andrés started with a small introduction about AST transformations, then I continued the workshop with <a href="https://github.com/melix/ast-workshop">a series of exercises</a> (that you can take for yourself). Unfortunately, two hours and a half didn’t give us enough time to complete all exercises but I was quite happy with the session. I really hope this gave ideas to some people in the room, and that it provided the necessary bits to get started. Note that if you missed it, I will give the same workshop at <a href="http://gr8conf.us/index">GR8Conf US in Minneapolis</a>, so register now!</p>

<h2 id="_type_checking_your_dsls">Type checking your DSLs</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I gave my second talk on Friday, last day of the conference. It was named <a href="http://gr8conf.us/Presentations/Type-checking-your-DSLs">Type checking your DSLs</a>. While I already gave this talk 3 times before (G&amp;G exchange, Greach and Devoxx France), I always like to change some contents to adapt to the audience and have some novelties inside. Unfortunately, for technical reasons, this talk went really bad for me. I assume people felt it, but I was quite disconcerted. The reason is that most of my talk relies on commenting code, but that I wasn’t able to show it properly! Even if the projectors were supposed to support full-HD through HDMI, for some obscure reason, my laptop wasn’t able to &#8220;discover&#8221; the HDMI output, and I was stuck to a 1024x768 VGA output. Worse than that, on screen, the borders were cut. This was the first time this ever happened to me, and to be honest, it completely troubled me. I wasn’t able to show code properly, so I wasn’t able to keep track of what I wanted to say. This was a horrible experience, but I hope people get the idea, as I only managed to give a rough idea of what I wanted to say :-( You know, that feeling when you try to explain something, and that people look at you as if you were an extraterrestrial…</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I will give the same talk at Minneapolis later this year, so I sincerely hope things will go better, especially because I really like this talk, which gives a lot of hints on the power of the language, combining several features available in Groovy 2.1. All the (uncut) slides are available <a href="https://github.com/melix/gr8confeu2013">on GitHub</a>.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Going to GR8Conf for the second time was like last year an incredible experience. I had the chance to talk to lots of talented and famous developers of the Groovy community, as well as sharing with users, which is worth the trip. This gave me for example the occasion to talk to two GPars brains for the first time (Dierk Koenig and Vaclav Pech). I’d really like to thank Soren for organizing this, as well as the crew for all the goodness that we can see here. I’m really looking forward to go to the next edition!</p>

  			<p>17 avril 2013</p>
			<p><em>Tags: </em>groovy </em> null </em> programming </p>

<h3 id="_null_safe_method_invocation">Null-safe method invocation</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Yesterday, I worked on <a href="http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/GROOVY-6101">a bug</a> reported on the static compiler of Groovy. It appeared that the underlying problem was related to how null-safe invocations are handled when the expected return type is a primitive. Let’s take an example:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>class Person {
   String name
   int age
}

Person getPerson() { null }

Person p = getPerson()

def result = p?.age
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now the question is, what is the value of <em>result</em>? If you run this in the Groovy console, the result would be <em>null</em>. This is compatible with the assumption that the null-safe invocation operator (?.) always return null if the receiver of the message is null (here, <em>p</em> is null, so result is null). The definition is pretty easy, but it gets more complicated if you slightly modify the code:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>int result = p?.age
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By explicitely setting the type to <em>int</em>, executing this would throw an error, stating that you cannot convert <em>null</em> to <em>int</em>. It makes sense knowing that the null-safe invoker is supposed to return null if the receiver is null, but it starts getting strange as if <em>p</em> is not null, the assignment is perfectly valid since <em>getAge()</em> is expected to return a primitive type… This means that unlike the &#8220;normal&#8221; invoker which is guaranteed to keep the method return type untouched, the null-safe invoker does not honor the method signature.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_the_dynamic_world">The dynamic world</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What if the null-safe invoker was aware of the return type? In &#8220;null-safe&#8221;, you must think about what the &#8220;safe&#8221; part stands for. It’s definitely the receiver, because you want the invocation to be safe (not failing) if the receiver is null. If the <strong>receiver</strong> is null, then return null. This means that because <em>p</em> is null, it chooses to return null, independently of the method that was supposed to be called. Here, the method was <em>getAge()</em>, which is supposed to return a primitive type. As null is not a primitive, I would expect the null-safe invoker to return a <em>default value</em> compatible with the primitive type. This means that here, I would expect the null-safe invoker to return <em>0</em>. Now, what is the problem with returning a default value? First of all, we’re in a dynamic world. This means that when <em>p?.age</em> is executed, the target method hasn’t been chosen, because you need to know the runtime type of <em>p</em> to determine what method will eventually be called. As <em>p</em> is null, the dynamic runtime doesn’t know the type of <em>p</em>, so has no idea that calling <em>age</em> would return a primitive type. Conclusion, in a dynamic world, the null-safe invoker must always return null, even if the expected method would return a primitive…</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_the_static_world">The static world</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now what if we’re in a pure static world? In that case, the method to be called is chosen at compile time, given the inferred type of <em>p</em>. It means that unlike the dynamic runtime, the static compiler, at this point, knows that <em>p.age</em> is <em>p.getAge()</em> which returns a primitive type. So it is capable of handling the null-safe invocation with what I think is better, semantically speaking: <em>null-safe</em> invocation only checks the receiver, and returns a value which depends on the return type of the method being invoked. So a static compiler is able to return <em>0</em> instead of the non-pritive <em>null</em>. What is funny is that I asked, on Twitter, what people expected from the result of <em>p?.getAge()</em> if <em>p</em> is null. Everybody answered <em>null</em>. So it’s clear that my way of thinking is not mainstream, but I’m ok with that. I just find it awkward that an operator which is supposed to act on invocation is also capable of altering the return type…</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Anyway, even if it’s possible for the static compiler to return a default value, the fix I pushed doesn’t do that. It will always return null. The main reason for doing that is not that it was easier to fix (it’s quite the opposite), but that it keeps the semantics of statically compiled Groovy equal to those of dynamic Groovy. As it’s not possible for the runtime to know what the method would return, always returning null is fine, even if some situations (static compilation), you know a bit more what would happen :)</p>
